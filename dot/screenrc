# Too often we forget multiuser screen sessions and leave them lying
# around when we shouldn't, since they persist after a network
# disconnect.
#
# It would, however, be nice to have a reminder that there's a timeout
# so we remember to disable it for those rare cases where want the
# session to persist.

idle 1800 kill

# Usage notes:
#
#   ^A is the default escape character for commands below
#   ^D   detach
#
#   screen -ls   to list screens
#   screen -x -r <pid>   to join a screen session (without detaching others)
#   screen -S <name>   to start a screen with a session name
#
# Multiuser:
#
#   :acladd <user>   to allow a user to access this screen
#
# If screen doesn't have the suid bit set (setting it is not recommended),
# then the sharing user will have to :multiuser on and :acladd root, and
# the other user will have to sudo the screen -x -r command.
#
# Standard techniques:
#
#   screen -S edit              # start a session for editing
#   export IGNOREEOF=3          # to avoid accidential exits from bash
#   ^A:acladd joe               # allow joe access
#   screen -x -r cjs/edit       # joe runs this to join the session
#   ^A:fit                      # change window size to size of current region
#                               #    (this terminal, usually)
#   ^A^D                        # detach screen session (without killing it)
